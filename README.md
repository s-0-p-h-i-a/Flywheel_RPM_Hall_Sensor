# Flywheel RPM Sensor Emulation (Proof-of-Concept)

**Goal:**  
Proof-of-concept Arduino project simulating flywheel RPM calculation with a Hall sensor, practicing **embedded signal acquisition, sensor processing, and iterative debugging**. Explores hardware constraints, applies on-the-fly learning, and parallels real automotive flywheel sensors.

See Dev Log for more detailed building + testing process log.

## Hardware

- Arduino Uno + V5 sensor shield

- Hall effect sensor module

- Digital push button module

- SG90 servo motor

- Cardboard disc with one magnet stuck to the edge, mounted on the servo

---
## Functionality

- Push button: turns servo on/off

- Hall sensor: detects magnet passing and calculates instantaneous and averaged RPM

- Serial output: prints RPM values for real-time monitoring


> ⚠️ Note: Servo powering is not yet fully implemented; current focus is on sensor reading, timing, and RPM calculation.

## Observations / Relevance to Automotive Sensors

> This setup emulates the RPM-measuring principle of a flywheel Hall sensor in a simplified way: the sensor reacts to a passing magnet, whereas automotive flywheel Hall sensors are magnetised and respond to ferrous teeth and gaps (e.g., 58 teeth with 2 missing). The single-magnet disc produces a discrete pulse per rotation, analogous to the double-LOW signal generated by missing teeth in real systems. This practices understanding of **sensor signal timing, pulse counting, and RPM calculation principles** in a controlled experiment.

## Learning & Debugging Highlights

- Explored sensor placement and signal reliability to maximize detection accuracy

- Averaged measurements to smooth RPM output and handle timing noise

- Experimented with servo control loops and timing considerations

- **Investigated hardware limitations on the fly**, including safe wire handling, voltage/current considerations, and power constraints for the servo

- Structured and iterative troubleshooting: identified root causes, tested alternative solutions, and documented outcomes

- Practiced **adaptivity and creative problem-solving**, considering multiple potential fixes in parallel

## Next Steps

- Implement reliable servo powering for continuous rotation

- Further refine proof-of-concept to approach real-world automotive sensor behavior
