# Flywheel RPM Sensor Emulation (Proof-of-Concept)

**Goal:**  
Proof-of-concept Arduino project simulating flywheel RPM calculation with a Hall sensor, practicing **embedded signal acquisition, sensor processing, and iterative debugging**. Explores hardware constraints, applies on-the-fly learning, and parallels real automotive flywheel sensors.

See [Build & Test Plan](Build_and_Test_Plan.md) for a detailed step-by-step guide to wiring, component testing, and control logic implementation.

## Latest Update (15/11)

- Successfully spliced hi-fi and USB wires for stable servo powering; reinforced with tape and zip ties.

- Breadboard Vcc/GND rail gaps identified and resolved; all components now share the same segment.

- Verified stable voltage: 5.09 V at splice, 5.08 V at breadboard.

- SG90 servo confirmed as standard (0–180° sweep only); updated logic and RPM calculation to account for two sensor passes per sweep.

- LED test and initial sensor/servo integration verified; hardware setup stable for first proof-of-concept runs.

## Hardware

- Arduino Uno + V5 sensor shield
- Hall effect sensor module
- Digital push button module
- SG90 standard servo motor (0–180° sweep)
- Cardboard disc with one magnet stuck to the edge, mounted on the servo
- Hi-fi power + GND wire roll (for safer, sturdier servo wiring)
- Additional USB-A cables (for splicing and backup)
- Crimp insulation tubes, electrical tape, and zip ties for secure connections
- Multimeter for verification and troubleshooting

> ⚠️ Note: Servo powering now uses spliced USB/hi-fi wires; breadboard Vcc/GND rail gaps were discovered and addressed for reliable connection.

## Functionality

- Push button: turns servo on/off
- Potentiometer: varies servo speed by adjusting update interval (mapped 20–80 ms)
- Hall sensor: detects magnet passing and calculates instantaneous and averaged RPM
- Serial output: prints RPM values and potentiometer-derived speed for real-time monitoring

> ⚠️ Note: The SG90 is a standard servo and can only sweep back and forth; previous assumptions of continuous rotation were incorrect. RPM calculation now accounts for **two sensor passes per sweep cycle**.

## Observations / Relevance to Automotive Sensors

> This setup emulates the RPM-measuring principle of a flywheel Hall sensor in a simplified way: the sensor reacts to a passing magnet, whereas automotive flywheel Hall sensors are magnetised and respond to ferrous teeth and gaps (e.g., 58 teeth with 2 missing). The single-magnet disc produces a discrete pulse per rotation, analogous to the double-LOW signal generated by missing teeth in real systems. This practices understanding of **sensor signal timing, pulse counting, and RPM calculation principles** in a controlled experiment.

## Learning & Debugging Highlights

- Developed and structured a **Build & Test Plan** to verify wiring, breadboard connections, control logic, and sensor integration before full servo deployment

- Explored sensor placement and signal reliability to maximise detection accuracy

- Averaged measurements to smooth RPM output and handle timing noise

- Experimented with servo control loops, step increments, and delay mapping for predictable speed

- Investigated hardware limitations on the fly, including safe wire handling, voltage/current considerations, and power constraints for the servo

- Structured and iterative troubleshooting: identified root causes, tested alternative solutions, and documented outcomes

- Practiced **adaptivity and creative problem-solving**, considering multiple potential fixes in parallel

- Learned to address breadboard Vcc/GND rail gaps and accommodate thick hi-fi wires via jumper splicing

- Verified stable voltage (5.09 V at splice, 5.08 V at breadboard) for safe testing

- Planned to update logic to reflect standard servo sweep behaviour and RPM calculation to account for two magnet passes per sweep

## Usage & Testing

> ⚠️ Note: The current Arduino sketch may not be fully functional. The main focus of this project iteration is hardware setup, wiring, and planning. Code will require editing and verification during progressive reintegration and testing of all components.

**1. Hardware Setup**
- Connect Arduino Uno to sensor shield.
- Mount SG90 servo with single magnet disc.
- Wire Hall sensor, push button, and potentiometer according to standard pin assignments.
- Ensure power is supplied via USB/hi-fi spliced cable (or alternative safe power source).

**2. Upload Sketch**
- Open the Arduino IDE and select the correct board and COM port.
- Upload the main project sketch.

**3. Verify Controls**
- Press the push button: servo should start/stop (on/off control).
- Adjust potentiometer: servo speed should change inversely with pot reading.

**4. Check Sensor Output**
- Observe Hall sensor pulses on Serial Plotter.
- Virtual RPM display should reflect expected speed based on step/delay mapping.
- Once Hall sensor is fully integrated, Serial Plotter will show real RPM readings.

**5. Troubleshooting Tips**
- If servo does not move: check wiring, power supply, and pin assignments.
- If Hall sensor readings are inconsistent: adjust magnet position and check sensor alignment.
- Use Serial Plotter to verify both virtual and sensor-derived RPM outputs.
- Refer to the Build & Test Plan

## Next Steps

- Validate potentiometer and push button control for variable-speed operation
- Integrate Hall sensor to calculate real-time RPM
- Test Serial Plotter display for both virtual and sensor-derived RPM readings
- Iterate and refine servo.move logic, step size, and delay mapping for smooth operation
- Progress towards simulating real-world automotive flywheel sensor behaviour
